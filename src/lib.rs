//! The `reversi` library (ver. 0.1.0) provides the main structures and mechanics required to run a Reversi game.
//! In view of possible AIs developement, the library keeps an eye on performances.
//! Released under MIT license.

// Roadmap to 0.1.0:
// ReversiError::NoUndo needs a turn::Turn value
// board::Board needs IntoIter so that its (unique) component can be made private
// Coord should be an enum with fields Cartesian{row: usize, col: usize} and Index(usize)
